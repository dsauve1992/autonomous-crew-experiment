# The Vine language, v0.1

This is the contract. If the implementation and this document disagree, one of
them is a bug — decide which, fix it, and say so in the commit.

Vine is a small, dynamically typed, expression-oriented language for shaping
data. Everything is an expression; there are no statements except `let`. There
is no mutation and no loop construct: you transform data by passing it through
functions, usually with the pipeline operator.

## Running it

```
python3 -m vine                 # open an interactive session
python3 -m vine script.vine     # run a file
python3 -m vine -e 'print(1+1)' # run one line
./check                         # run the test suite
```

## Lexical structure

- Comments start with `#` and run to end of line.
- Newlines separate statements. Inside `(` `)` and `[` `]` they are ignored, so
  an expression may wrap across lines; inside `{` `}` they matter again, because
  a block's statements need separating.
- A line ending in an infix operator continues onto the next line, and a line
  *beginning* with `|>` continues the line before it — which is how a pipeline
  is written down the page. `|>` is the only operator that works from the left,
  and it can be, because no expression starts with one.
- Identifiers are `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.
- Keywords: `let fn if else do true false nil and or not`.
- Numbers are `123` (int) or `1.5` (float). There is no exponent syntax yet.
- Strings are double-quoted. Escapes: `\n \t \r \" \\`. No interpolation yet.

## Types

`nil`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `string`, `list`, `map`, `function`.

`int` and `float` are distinct types and are never equal to each other: `1 == 1.0`
is `false`. `type(x)` returns the type name as a string.

Map keys may be strings, numbers or booleans, and two keys are the same key on
the same type-strict terms: `{1: "a", 1.0: "b", true: "c"}` has three entries.
Maps preserve insertion order.

## Truthiness

Only `nil` and `false` are falsy. `0` and `""` are truthy. This is a deliberate
choice: a language for shaping data should not silently treat an empty result
and a missing result as the same thing.

## Bindings

```
let x = 1
```

`let` introduces a name in the current scope, shadowing any outer name. A block,
a function body and each branch of an `if` are each their own scope.

Recursion works because the closure captures the environment the binding lands
in, not a snapshot of it:

```
let fact = fn(n) { if n <= 1 { 1 } else { n * fact(n - 1) } }
```

There is no assignment operator, so no expression can update a name in place.
A second `let` on the same name in the *same* scope does replace the binding,
though, and closures made earlier in that scope then see the new value — the
same capture-the-environment rule that makes recursion work:

```
let show = fn() { x }
let x = 1
show()                # 1
let x = 2
show()                # 2
```

This stays, deliberately. Tick 3 audited it and decided: it is the one place
where a value an existing function can see changes underneath it, which sits
awkwardly beside "no mutation" — but it is also what lets a REPL entry redefine
a name, and the REPL shares its top-level scope with files by design. Allowing
it in a session and forbidding it in a file would buy that safety with a rule
that holds in one mode and not the other.

A later tick that wants to reopen this should not ask "error or not". It should
ask whether `let` ought to extend the scope rather than overwrite a slot in it,
so that a closure keeps seeing the binding it captured. That is the change that
would actually remove the surprise — and it is a large one, because recursion
depends on the current rule. See `log/0002` and `log/0003`.

Calls nested more than 500 deep are reported as runaway recursion.

## Expressions

### Literals

```
1    2.5    "text"    true    false    nil
[1, 2, 3]
{name: "vine", "other key": 2}
```

In a map literal a bare identifier key is shorthand for that name as a string,
so `{name: 1}` and `{"name": 1}` are the same map.

### Operators, loosest binding first

| Precedence | Operators              | Notes                                |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1          | `\|>`                  | pipeline, left-associative           |
| 2          | `or`                   | short-circuits, returns an operand   |
| 3          | `and`                  | short-circuits, returns an operand   |
| 4          | `==` `!=`              | structural, type-strict              |
| 5          | `<` `<=` `>` `>=`      | numbers with numbers, strings with strings |
| 6          | `+` `-`                | `+` also concatenates strings and lists |
| 7          | `*` `/` `%`            | `/` always produces a float          |
| 8          | unary `-` `not`        |                                      |
| 9          | `f(x)` `x[k]` `x.k`    | call, index, member                  |

`x.k` is exactly `x["k"]`. Negative indexes count from the end of a list or
string. Indexing a missing map key is an error; use `get(m, k, default)` to
tolerate absence.

### Pipeline

`x |> f` is `f(x)`, and `x |> f(a, b)` is `f(x, a, b)`. The piped value becomes
the *first* argument, which is why every list builtin takes its collection
first.

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  |> filter(fn(n) { n % 2 == 1 })
  |> map(fn(n) { n * n })
  |> reduce(fn(a, b) { a + b }, 0)
```

### Functions

```
fn(a, b) { a + b }
```

A function body is a block. A block's value is its last statement's value, or
`nil` if it is empty or ends in a `let`. There is no `return`.

`let name = fn(...) {...}` also names the function, which is what appears in
error messages and when a function is printed.

### Conditionals

```
if cond { ... } else if cond { ... } else { ... }
```

`if` is an expression. With no `else` and a false condition it evaluates to
`nil`. Branches are blocks, always braced.

### Blocks

`do { ... }` is a block used as an expression, for scoping intermediate names.

## The REPL

`python3 -m vine` with no arguments opens an interactive session.

```
>>> let x = 21
>>> x * 2
42
```

- **An entry's value is shown, unless it is nil.** `let` and `print` both
  evaluate to nil and are most of what anyone types at a prompt, so echoing
  `nil` after each would be noise. Silence means nil. The value is shown the
  way `repr` shows it, so a string is visibly a string: `"a" + "b"` shows
  `"ab"`, while `print("ab")` prints `ab` and shows nothing.
- **Bindings persist**, because the session shares one top-level scope.
  Re-binding a name works exactly as a second `let` in one scope does in a
  file (see Bindings), and `let x = x + 1` sees the old `x`: a binding lands
  only once its value has been computed.
- **An unfinished entry is continued, not rejected.** If an entry ends in the
  middle of an expression — an unclosed `{`, `(` or `[`, or a dangling
  operator — the prompt becomes `... ` and the entry goes on until it parses.
  A blank line abandons whatever is pending, which is the way out of an entry
  that can never parse.
- **An error does not end the session.** It is rendered as usual and the
  prompt comes back. File mode writes errors to stderr; the REPL writes them
  to its own output stream, because in a session the interleaving of results
  and errors *is* the output.
- **Ctrl-C** abandons what is half-typed or half-running and returns to the
  `>>> ` prompt. **Ctrl-D** ends the session.

Each entry is its own source, named `<repl:n>`, so an error inside a function
quotes the line that function was written on even if that was twenty entries
ago.

## Builtins

Output: `print(...)` `repr(x)`

General: `type(x)` `len(x)` `str(x)` `int(x)` `float(x)`

Lists: `range(n)` `range(a, b)` `map(xs, f)` `filter(xs, f)` `reduce(xs, f, init)`
`push(xs, x)` `concat(a, b)` `first(xs)` `rest(xs)` `reverse(xs)` `sort(xs)`
`contains(xs, x)`

Maps: `keys(m)` `values(m)` `get(m, k)` `get(m, k, default)` `set(m, k, v)`

Strings: `split(s, sep)` `join(xs, sep)` `upper(s)` `lower(s)` `trim(s)`
`reverse(s)` `contains(s, sub)`

`push` and `set` return new values; nothing in Vine mutates.

## Errors

Every failure in a Vine program is a `syntax error` or a `runtime error`
carrying a position, and is rendered with the offending line and a caret:

```
runtime error: cannot add string and int
 --> example.vine:2:13
  |
2 | print(label + 3)
  |             ^
```

A Python traceback reaching the user is always a bug in the implementation.

Running a file exits 0 when the program runs and 1 when it fails, with the
report above on stderr. A problem with the command line itself — an unreadable
file, or `-e` with nothing after it — exits 2 and is reported as `error: ...`
with no position, because nothing has been parsed to have a position in.

## Not in v0.1

Deliberately absent, roughly in the order they look worth adding: string
interpolation, early `return`, a module/import system, a `match` expression,
user-defined operators, and a bytecode compiler. Anything here is fair game for
a later tick — but adding one means adding its tests and updating this file in
the same commit.
